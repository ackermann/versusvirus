2,Art & Culture,Cultural Experiences go Online,"With the current measures in place (and potential restrictions until the end of the year), museums and exhibitions are fighting for their economic survival, and a lot of people are confined to their four walls at home. But also during ""normal"" times, a part of the population is not able to visit museums etc, such as elderly people or people with walking difficulties.","How can we transform the cultural events, museums and art experiences to a digital channel and make it accessible remotely? How can we extent this solution also for older people?","A potential solution that has been suggested: - A simple and functional platform, bringing together children, grandchildren and grandparents. Ideally, for first prototyping streams of ""Tagesschau"" are implemented, later theatre performances - it combines synchronized streaming and videochat, but according to the principles of KISS (keep it simple and smart) - in short: it must work. No useless functions.",,
3,Art & Culture,Together into the virtual pandemic museum!,"Museums are closed, we stay at home and the Corona pandemic is THE topic. We spend the days alone with Netflix, home office and home workout.",We can't go to the museum together anymore. How can we gather new impressions from home and discover art and culture with other people?,"An independent digital museum that we visit together. We enter the museum individually or in groups and browse the rooms. We are connected via an audio chat and exchange information. In the rooms, content on the topic of pandemic is conveyed.","Research of public domain content, editing, illustration, UX design, back-end & front-end programming",
4,Art & Culture,Culture and health for a sustainable future,"People are forced to stay home and need/deserve creative outlets to help them cope, be inspired and make everyone feel connected through a shared love of art, creation, and life.","The wide range of media channels and disperse information makes it hard for people to understand the available cultural offering, both at the national and international level, and how to access it.","The creation of a web-information hub, in collaboration with the site culturaesalute.ch, which will contain Switzerland’s digital cultural offer as a whole, offering direct access to museums, music, dance, and theatre experiences through virtual views accessible directly from home.","We already own a solid database of relevant information, but would need help constructing and implementing the webpage.","Cultural Department, City of Lugano in collaboration with IBSA Foundation, as part of Lugano Living Lab"
5,Art & Culture,Virtual tourism ,Virtually free,"It is not possible to travel, tourism specialits are suffering and it probably will last a long period; people need to have distractions.","Virtual tourism with 3D glasses and possibility to do a virtual visit paying entry to museums etc, paying the tourism specialist that gave the opportunity of having the application (he can do the film with a drone also), and also the possibility to order a meal of the place visited, to hear music, to buy souvenirs, and everything is delivered at home.

6,Art & Culture,Apollo 13 - Art in Isolation,"Children in homeschooling learn math, grammar, etc. With all the homework is not enough room left for creativity, art and theatre. Learning how to be creative with drawings, performances, audio or installations is important also in time of crisis.","Theatre and art-projects in schools and have been cancelled with no replacement online. Artists and art pedagogues are out of work right now, this project should bring this together.","A platform where parents and teachers find inspiring tasks for children, children find and share creativity and enables art and theatre-teachers to continue with their classes online. Children get in contact with and feedback from professional artists and pedagogues.","We are a group of freelance theatre-pedagogues that had the idea and called it Apollo 13 - Art in Isolation.

8,After the Crisis,Transparency of investments and fundings for a circular economy,"States and companies are now investing millions in the preservation of the economy. Only this week, the Swiss government has put together an economic aid package worth about CHF 42 billion, that could be topped up in the next days.",How to make sure that the money does not go to the preservation of our linear model but also help to foster the transition to a circular and sustainable economic model? ,Developing an overview of consequent public and private investments and creating transparency on how this money is spent by companies. Some incentives and programs to support companies to make the right investment / development choices. ,"We have expertise in the Circular Economy and regulatory framework - please reach out for specific resources and reports.

Worldwide initiatives are  launched and thousands of people engage, support and even work pro bono for a better cause. ","We need to generate a solution to continuously drive this ""better human behavior"" mindset-shift across the globe. And by doing so, decrease human disengagement, frustration (of being isolated, sick or jobless etc.) or even potentials for crimes and revolutions.","Design the ""NextNow"" reward model based on human behavior and engagement.Tokens (smart contracts) serve as trophies.

We are instructed to stay at home if possible. ,How does our mobility in Switzerland change during and after the Corona period? How does the choice of transport mode change?,A visualization that shows how mobility behavior changes would be exciting. ,Surveys could be conducted and transaction data analysed. ,Bundesamt für Verkehr
11,After the Crisis,How to relaunch tourism after the crisis? ,"The Covid-19 has generated important economic repercussions for the tourism sector: cancelled bookings, uncertainty, liquidity problems. ","How to bring people back to buy, go to restaurants and other public places, attend events, use public transport and go on holiday (or anything related to tourism) without the fear or skepticism that will obviously continue in part (at least for some people) even when the emergency is over. Also useful are proposals for revenue differentiation (even during the crisis period). ",,Proposals at product level but also at communication level. Useful best practices (if available). ,
12,After the Crisis,True Heroes,The crisis shows which jobs and sectors are actually systemically relevant. This awareness (and the corresponding appreciation) should not be lost even after the crisis.,How do we succeed in anchoring an awareness of the importance of the truly systemically relevant institutions and professions in society?,"E.g. crowd-funding of holiday bonuses for everyone who had to work during the crisis; donations of bank bonuses to nursing staff etc.; initiative for remuneration according to systemic relevance; campaign for the ""True Heroes"" in the media; call for various gratitude actions (random idea e.g.: Guezli for de Güselma)","Innovative, realistic project idea that aims for long-term, systemic impact.",
13,After the Crisis,Crisis Learnings for Climate Change,The crisis shows the leaks we have in our system and supply chains when it comes to a crisis. Climate change will at one point also require a fast systemic adaptation.  ,"What are system-relevant components for Switzerland to function (learnings form this crisis) and what conclusions can be drawn to be better prepared in the face of an upcoming climate crisis (e.g. how do we deal with our dependency on oil, gas, food, drugs, workforce from outside Switzerland)?","E.g. a platform that collects learnings from this crisis, extends it with specific challenges we will face in a climate crisis (contributed by experts) and advocates specific actions that should be taken in order to be better prepared/ready. ",,
14,After the Crisis,On the net to restart,Micro enterprises (up to 9 employees) have to solve similar problems. Each one looks for solutions and invests resources when they could join forces and share tools (HW and SW) and also human resources. ,"Identify processes and technical solutions to help micro enterprises to ""network"", i.e.: address the market with products or services that better meet customer needs and find solutions to common problems (accounting, marketing, etc.).
Networks can be between companies in the same sector (horizontal networks) or between companies in different but complementary sectors, for example in tourism (vertical networks).
",Networks of micro and small enterprises are a reality abroad (https://retipmi.it or www.12tomany.it). In Switzerland there are only a few examples in the hotel sector or in vocational training (https://www.berufsbildung.ch/dyn/3553.aspx). Processes and solutions are sought to implement and promote them in Switzerland as well.,We look for processes and ideas to promote trust between companies and their collaboration. Useful to have a list of examples of business networks that work and some companies available to test the model. ,
15,After the Crisis,Becoming a value society,"In the present time values like solidarity, consideration etc. are capitalized. What is the situation after the crisis?","Learning from the crisis. That we become a value society again. The main values I count as decency, consideration, tolerance, acceptance and helpfulness. Much more WE and less I!",,,"This challenge has been submitted by the ""Blick voting""."
16,After the Crisis,Out of the economic depression with an infrastructure program focusing on renewable energy sources,"Because of the Corona Virus, I am not just expecting a recession, but a depression. Ways out of such an economic crisis are often infrastructure programs. I also see the Corona crisis as an opportunity to tackle the climate crisis more aggressively. To achieve the energy transition, we need to activate more renewable energy sources.","How can we initiate an infrastructure program (or at least part of one) that helps the economy out of the Corona crisis and paves the way for a sustainable and renewable energy future? // Wie können wir ein Infrastrukturprogramm (oder zumindest einen Teil davon) initiieren, welches der Wirtschaft aus der Corona-Krise hilft und die Wege in eine nachhaltige und erneuerbare Energiezukunft ebnet?","I believe it would be interesting to identify barriers that currently exist on the way to build up more renewable energy sources. On one end there are regulatory aspects and maybe missing incentives. Who is responsible for setting those incentives? How can we reach them and motivate them to change regulation so that renewables can grow? On the other end there are different actors that could be potentially involved in the process: land owners, roof owners, home owners, planners, architects, builders, children, PV specialists, another important group I may not have thought of. How could processes to build more renewables be made easier. How can information on e. g. PV potential, funding, how to get it done be well connected to help renewable energy sources grow. On one hand we would do something against climate change on the other hand we can create a lot of jobs in this sector and help to get the economy going again. ",,

Training materials for Health workers,I have the WHO suggested immunization schedule but I need communication and training experts to convert them into key messages,
18,After the Crisis,Beyond GDP idea on companies,"The crisis shows that a company's relevance does not reflect in their sales and net worth only. There are other components just as important, such as whether they serve fundamental human needs, incude longterm sustainability, contribute to peoples well beeing (social entrepreurship) etc. ","How could we advocate a system with a multi-dimentional understanding and evaluation of companies' relevance, that includes more than  ","EU Commition: ""The Beyond GDP initiative is about developing indicators that are as clear and appealing as GDP, but more inclusive of environmental and social aspects of progress"". How could we adapt this idea to our market and companies and work towards its implementation? ","concept of an innovative, realistic long term idea",
19,After the Crisis,Crisis backlog - Identification & prioritization of necessities,"Due to the crisis, people (doctors, citizens, entrepreneurs ...) identify day-to-days new issues or requirements. They need to raise them, to allow the authorities to identify and evaluate what is happening. Thus those last ones would be able to prioritize the requests for covering them in time.","How to help people (Doctors, citizens, entrepreneurs ...) to raise their need? evaluate the criticality?
How to help authorities (government, NGO, management in other organization) to ease the prioritization?","An accessible & ergonomic App/website to collect and prioritize the problem encountered by people (eg. Decidim) feeding a crisis backlog.

20,After the Crisis,"Future-fit economies and society: From the activities and behaviors adopted during the crisis, which ones do we want to keep and develop post-Covid-19? ","During the crisis we witnessed a strengthening of social networks/ neighbourhoods, increased use of virtual connections tools (overcoming resistance to new ways of connecting) and growth of available educational information on how to live well with less (e.g. travel, information overload, consumption of non-essential items) whilst spending more time with nuclear family, hobbies or decluttering our lives.

It should not be “just another app” but one with high potential for integration into their everyday even after the crisis. Please think of where it should be used to reach a maximum amount of people. It does not have to cover all sectors but can select one. It’s important that the solution will have a high acceptance also after the crisis.
",
21,After the Crisis,Let's take the opportunity to change ... at last!,"Our consumption has a price, a high price, which is not only the one we pay at the cash register. A price for our planet above all: wasted precious raw materials, grey energy, pollution, and not forgetting the tons of waste that often end up in nature. And a price for our quality of life: we have to earn more and more money to be able to consume more and more. The stands that advertising shows us push us to change our clothes and the objects we use all the time. In order to be ""fashionable"" we have to keep up. What a stress! What if we learn to define our real needs? What if we tried to determine what our real values are? What makes us really happy? What if we gave our lives a little more peace and quiet, if we stopped running? How about taking a little more care of our planet?
","How can we take advantage of this period during which we can no longer go to the shops to learn to identify our real needs, to realize the damage that current consumption is doing to the environment but also the stress it brings to our lives (earning enough to buy the latest model, being fashionable, etc.). How can we take advantage of the confinement, this free time we have and especially what we live and experience, to reflect, to prepare ourselves to change our consumption patterns when we can go out and the shops will be open again.

","We don't have a solution. We are already setting up awareness projects, even before this period. But this is a forced experience that people go through that can help open their eyes! We must take advantage of this opportunity. This can be for children (education) but above all for everyone.",This challenge is general and can lead to many concrete ideas. So it is impossible to list needs at this stage.,
22,After the Crisis,What can we learn from Covid and how can we transform these learnings?,"In order to prevent Covid from spreading too fast and in order to protect risk groups, we took   a variety of measures such as staying at home when feeling sick, social distancing, washing hands regularly and sneezing/coughing in the elbow. During the regular flu season (and other instances), we could apply the same measures. Not only would society in general benefit from this, but also could companies reduce their risk of too many employees being sick at the same time, reduce health costs (for everyone) because less people are sick and finally,  reduce stress of employees because they have to jump in for their colleagues. ","How can we transform C19 learnings of solidarity and behaviour into ordinary times, such as washing hands regularly, staying at home when you feel flu symptoms and government information on what is happening?",,nothing specific. ,
23,After the Crisis,"Making Swiss Food Great Again: A challenge for Farmers, Gardeners, and everyone","Covid-19 makes us feel the risks of our globalized food system. Switzerland is only 56% self-sufficient and our diets are bad for the climate. But still, local farmers are struggling to sell their produce due to restaurant closures.","1-Farmers: How to support their livelihoods whilst keeping nature healthy?
2-People don’t know what to buy with a clean conscience. With Corona, many have started to buy more locally & launched urban gardens, but don’t know much about growing food. ","1-Farmers: agroecology, solidarity & regenerative agriculture are promising solutions, but haven’t been able to go beyond niche markets in CH. How could we help to boost these approaches?
2-Fun educative material in swiss languages & supporting kits “for dummies” ","1) Additional ideas for potential solutions! 2) Expertise on food growing & agroecology from A-Z: soil/compost, seed, how & where & when to plant, pests&nutrients, seedlings, growing phase, harvest, and: what to do with the food once harvested? 3) Potential implementing partners",
24,After the Crisis,Local Food For All,"Half of all vegetables and fruits consumed in Switzerland are imported, although some studies have shown that Switzerland could be self-sufficient. Regarding goods, like in the majority of Europe’s countries, supply chains are spread out all over the globe, leading to high emission rates, lack of transparency and interdependencies for nations and economy.
Local, high-quality and fresh food producers can hardly compete with supermarkets, whose cheapest prices are enabled by a highly globalised economy. During this crisis specifically, small and medium enterprises are suffering even more as access to local food sources has been restricted. How can we increase the accessibility of local, seasonal, equitable and sustainable food for consumers as well as reduce food waste, both during and after the crisis?  
Due to Corona, normal functioning of supply chains is not given anymore because of missing field workers from abroad, higher demand on certain products, and unforseeable food price fluctuations on international markets.","How can the positive effects (higher demand for farmers produce directly from farm) on sustainble products (i.e. vegetables) be moved into the times after Corona? How can we foster better structures for direct marketing to support this demand in the future?
How can we support the relocalization of production in order to decrease impact on the environment and empower local producers, while giving Swiss citizens better access to qualitative food and goods? 
Ensuring that local producers' supply can meet the consumers' demand by creating diverse and innovative distribution channels. Ensuring that consumers have consistent, easy and affordable access to high-quality fresh food. ","Different solutiosn have been suggested:
- An example could be to create an overview of products, classifying them according to the amount of kilometer they have been produced from and give consumers incentives to choose the ones produced closer to their homes. Another example can be the creation of micro-factories around the world.
- Ensuring that local producers' supply can meet the consumers' demand by creating diverse and innovative distribution channels. Ensuring that consumers have consistent, easy and affordable access to high-quality fresh food. ","Different resources have been requested: 
- We have a set of experts in the Circular Economy and food topic. We don’t have any concrete idea material for this challenge yet but would like to emphasize the importance of the topic - please contact us for specific reports or information. 
- Supermarkets and farmers as implementation partners, datasets of their respective inventories.  
- Contacts with farmers and others who have good functioning structures. Data about producers who cannot sale their products and the moment (countrywide). Own knowledge about alternative supply chains. ","Centre for Development and Environment, University of Bern"
25,After the Crisis,Economic independence,Does it make more sense in the future to retain or bring back relevant economic sectors in Switzerland in order to guarantee the necessary supply chains,"Independence of Switzerland with regard to supply chains in relation to other countries. In some cases, this would create more jobs for less well-trained employees who would fall victim to digitisation. ","Instead of social benefits for the unemployed, such jobs could be subsidised (under strict conditions of course).",,
26,After the Crisis,Functioning health system after the crisis,"At the moment, people in health care professions are doing an enormous amount.","A health system that continues to function after the crisis. This is because I fear that many people in the health professions - especially hospitals - will fall into a state of exhaustion depression (burnout) and thus will no longer be able to work or only to a lesser extent. As a result, psychiatry is demanding increased benefits (treatment of burnout), which unfortunately are increasingly not covered by insurance.

27,Crime Reduction,Stop GAFA Depedency,"Containment has given even more power to the GAFA, holders of the massively used applications for work or entertainment. Our smartphones = work and communication tools but also spyware.
","Our data must stay in Switzerland!
","The ""Swiss Valley""  and a robust digital policy must be developed.",,
28,Crime Reduction,Platform of security companies at the service of the cantons,"The cantons must quickly commission security companies to provide a variety of services, including police support.",The cantons do not know where to address requests for security guards.,a platform that informs in real time of the number of agents available per canton for a limited number of services,"We have a list of services, rates, number of agents at time T, general conditions but we need an online platform that can work for the cantons and that can be updated at any time.",
29,Crime Reduction,Shelter Application,Whole families must remain at home in isolation. Tensions between couples are increasing and with them the incidence of domestic violence.,"Urgently needed shelters are currently lacking. Furthermore, apartments and tourist accommodation are vacant, which could be used as a temporary solution. The two target groups - victims of domestic violence and real estate managers respectively operators of tourist accommodation - are to be mediated between each other.","An anonymous online platform which can be used exclusively by the target groups. This means that offenders must not have access to the locations of the shelters. For example, the administrative staff of sheltered housing facilities could be considered as intermediaries (at present probably by phone).","Contact details of sheltered housing facilities in Switzerland. Their administration staff is at best also tester of the software. Additionally, it should be clarified where the need exists to provide an empty apartment or tourist accommodation for our purpose.",
30,Crime Reduction,immune helping hand for kids in (potentially) violent families,"Because of Corona, most children are always at home and should also do their homework. Certain parents are overburdened and react with violence against their children. Domestic violence can be reduced if the parents can recover from their children for a few hours a week. ","The children of these families should be looked after by others for a few hours a week. There should be one trustworthy, stress-resistant, immune person per family who is selected, monitored and advised by an authority. A place for the care would have to be found (empty gymnasiums, kindergartens), which afterwards may no longer be used for the lifetime of the viruses. How to find matches between families, volunteers, the authority and the place?
","Families could be found through the KESB, this could possibly also be the competent authority, places could be school facilities. The challenge is to find and identify the immune volunteers. ",,Schweizerische Kriminalprävention
31,Crime Reduction,A Super-Nanny-Date to prevent domestic violence,"Overworked parents are currently not relieved by babysitters, grandparents etc. They have to take care of their partly very demanding children on their own. This can lead to physical and psychological violence against the children. ","How can overburdened or specially challenged parents in the corona crisis get support and relief in education without physical contact?
In concrete terms: Which authorities and institutions have competent personnel for such a task? How can families be found who want or should accept this offer? How can this family be technically equipped to enable online dating and who pays for it?","Parents have regular on-screen dates with an educational consultant (Super Nanny). There, parents and children can talk about how things are going. The counsellor can also arrange a date just with the child and keep him or her busy for a while. The family receives support, has a structure through the regular dates, can discuss challenges, prevent crises and the parents have an adult counterpart who listens to their problems with the child and takes them seriously. ",,Schweizerische Kriminalprävention
32,Crime Reduction,Second home as shelter for victims of violence,The women's shelters in Switzerland have too few places (frauenhaus-schweiz.ch) and domestic violence is already a major problem in our country even without Corona (see also csvd.ch).,How and where can the women's shelters accommodate women and children affected by violence when their houses are full or when the people affected by violence are risk patients? Which additional professionals could take care of these people and under what conditions? ,"There are many people in Switzerland with a second home or an additional shared room at the place of work etc. It would be necessary to find out which of these people would agree to make their accommodation temporarily available to people affected by violence. 
Perhaps there would be people among the prospective psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists or social workers who would volunteer to work under the supervision of their training centre. ",,Schweizerische Kriminalprävention
33,Crime Reduction,Prevention of domestic violence,"Due to the stress at home, the current situation might lead to an increase in domestic violence. People are increasingly more stressed. Anxiety, anger, financial difficulties, restricted spaces can lead to more people being exposed to domestic violence.
Calling for help (ex. a helpline) is more difficult their perpetrators are always closeby.",What can be done to prevent an increase in spousal or family violence (verbal or physical)? What support is available in case of difficulty? How can we help people experiencing violence? How can we provide adequate Council?,"Several solutions have been suggested:

- Coordinate federal solutions & implementing experts in the field","Several resources have been requested:
- Expertise in prevention of violence, victim support, social work, psychological therapy etc. 
- Further resources that can be helpful: Papers, RCT, pilots, ideas on already established interventions",
34,Dissemination Prevention,Self Diagnosis,"Many people think they may have COVID-19 but can't get tested. Some scared people tend to go to Hospital/Doctor even when they are not ""sick enough"", causing overload of sanitary system and increasing risks. Some other people are almost asymptomatic and during this crisis there have been significant cases of people arriving at the Hospital either too late or when the disease status was already very advanced, causing extra need for care or extra fatalities. Any information that reduced their uncertainty would be extremely welcome. Government cannot test all 8.5M people and testing is a key prevention/treatment method.","How can we get an idea of how many people might have the virus which will not be tested? Crowd source illness reports to aid an early warning system for governments and the population. Create a devide, or transform the mobile phone as device to detect virus in our body. Allow people to perform medical grade screening at home by mean of a mobile medical device connected to smartphone. It should be possible to build an online self-diagnosis app that gives a rough indication of how likely you are to have COVID-19. If the app says the probability is high, it will be easier to get a real test. Achieve scale in testing (with some confidence) across Switzerland so BAG can be more effective in isolating, treating and preventing spread.","Several solutions have been suggested:
- Simple app for people to log themselves (limited PII), view data around them and larger orgs to calculate impacts through dashboards.
- look forward for futuristic minds who can create the way to transform the mobile phone, or a small device connected to the m. phone, in order to have immediate results also to share
- Medical Device capable to perform auscultation (to diagnose lung status), SpO2, temp and cough/hour measures. Device shall be bought just like today we do with thermometer or blood pressure. System shall be able to work on 2 levels: 1) self-assessment  2) Physician based data interpretation, remote reporting, small-fee based. No contact, no risk of infection, no loss of time for handling and patient preparation. Physician can just have all the data at glance, and look at evolution in the last days/hours.
- Telehealth mobile application (app) with specific short questions for user i.e. risk groups and professionals in contact with risk groups (e.g. home care givers). 
- App that self-tests individuals based on medical symptoms, historical geo location, etc. then  recommends what to do e.g. go for real test, stay at home, eating habits, etc.
- I envision a crowd-sourcing/machine learning approach. People who have had a test and know their status can upload material to a site, which accumulates a database of examples. The data is used to train machine learning classifiers. As the database grows, the quality will improve.
- Self-registration app with symptoms tracking and prediction of course of disease and potential hospitalisation","Different resources have been requested:
- I have a system to utilize graph db and build appropriate API’s. Require Frontend Devs, visualization and thinkers. Make it attractive to use.
- we need somebody in engeneering, cad and product development, data analysis
- Investment support to bring tele-medicine to a new level. South Korea was able to avoid lock-down because they massively invested in tech during past SARS.
- The team would need medical, social and digital expertise. 
- Need developers if app, Decision tree based on symptoms, Access to data from telecom or phone geo location (while ensuring privacy), Home treatment (e.g. for strengthening immune system), etc. 
- A basic version could be implemented quickly by a small team (~6-8 people) which combined web application developers, machine learning experts and doctors. 
- bright minds, app developers, data analysing","A similar challenge (without a suggested solution) has been has been submitted by the Federal Office of Public Health. Due to the current crisis, they will not be able to provide additional support to the teams throughout the Hackathon. Nevertheless, they are looking forward to seeing the results after the weekend!"
35,Dissemination Prevention,Using serological test results,This challenge is based on the existence of a serological test to determine a person's immunity (through the presence of antibodies) to COVID-19.,"The need is for a system that can communicate the result of the serological test to the patient being tested and that can be used for identification purposes. For example, this would allow the immunized person to return to work or to interact with specific groups, particularly at risk groups.",,"The solution should ideally include a draft process, a communication strategy, an evaluation of risks and a tool. This system should be reliable, ultra-secure and should comply with the legal provisions on data protection.",Genève Lab (State of Geneva)
36,Dissemination Prevention,UV Versus Virus,"A lot of infrastructures risk now to be considered contaminated (Transports, hospitals, money, workplaces, schools, elderly institutions...) and it is difficult to dsterilizeisinfect these objects or places. Investigations of the Robert Koch Institute have shown that the infectivity of SARS-CoV (not Sars-CoV-2!) could be reliably reduced by using UVC radiation. (see https://www.bioclimatic.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Gutachten%20Viroxx%20SARS_DE.pdf.",How to implement a full project of UV-disinfection (on any kind of level)?,"Several solutions of implementations have been suggested:
 - Appropriate measures are to be taken in future to prevent viruses and bacteria from being transmitted through the use of trays at airport security checkpoints. Sketch a technical solution integrated into the security control lines of airports to prevent the transmission of viruses and bacteria.
 - Envision a string of 'christmas lights' except instead of regular LED's, using UV-C LED's, placed within a cash register, allowing automatic sterilization of money.

37,Dissemination Prevention,Solutions to encourage COVID-19 positive people or exposed people to comply with auto-isolation rules.,"After the first epidemic wave, there will be a progressive ending of the confinement. To prevent a second wave, it will be essential that specific individuals (new tested COVID-19 positive people or exposed individuals) comply with auto-isolation rules. Ideally, this should take place without coercive measures.","How can we encourage (with positive incentives) new COVID+ or exposed individuals to voluntarily comply with self-isolation rules, after the peak of the epidemic, while the general confinement will be progressively relaxed for the rest of the population?","Ideally, the proposed solution will contain the following elements: 1) a cartography of relevant population groups with their needs and an evaluation of their risk of non-confinement respect; 2) a corresponding listing of actions or ideas to fill these needs and to incentivize them to stay strictly at home, including for each action or idea its target group, an evaluation of the efficacy of the measures, a (rough) evaluation of the cost and a proposed communication strategy. It must be possible to fully implement the proposed solution within 3-4 weeks.","The solution may contain examples, references to successful initiatives abroad. If possible, it should be based on user research (for instance through a survey, including of past COVID-19 self-isolated patients or suspected patients in regard to their needs in self-isolation). Creative solutions, cheap, and easily implementable are welcome.",Genève Lab (State of Geneva)

Although handwashing with soap is the first solution to prevent the spread of the virus through contact with surfaces, there are situations where this is not possible outside the home, in common areas, shops, post offices, pharmacies, etc... In this case, personal hydroalcoholic gel is a protective solution. However, it is no longer possible to obtain it in a fair way.","To provide each citizen, each person, with a personal bottle of hydroalcoholic gel, and to organize a way to fill it in a simple and safe way, close to the place where they live.

41,Dissemination Prevention,Tracing App,"We often don't know how close we are to the spread of infection and what are the chances of us contracting it, hence we don't often take the necessary precautions. Asymptomatic people can infect others. It is often difficult to identify all people in contact with an infected person.","How can a more efficient contact tracing of positive cases be pursued, taking into account fundamental rights (consider different aspects: technological solutions vs. governance issues vs. attitudes and behaviour). What might an international or cross-border solution look like?","Several solutions have been suggested:
- Use the Singapore gov approach 
- Code is available open source. See bluetrace dot io and google for trace together.
- We propose an app which notifies the user of the instances of COVID-19 spreading in their locality and precautions to be taken, by forming clusters of the cases and testing whether the user’s location lies in those through various heuristics.
A mobile App which tracks your health and exposure to others, alerting you if your risk of exposure changes because of your health or if you've been exposed to infected people or places.
- Solution is a phone application that uses Bluetooth to detect which phones were within 6 feet range and for how long. All phones then remember that information. If one phone owner gets COVID-19, the others that were tagged are informed.
- Mobile APP: using Bluetooth (BLE) phone technology, sending a beacon which is an HASH of the MAC address of BT phone interface. APP scans for beacon around and sends a daily report of other MAC met. In case of positive person, all the MACs are notified. Impossible to rebuild people identity, instant in notifying the network of people at risk. No action required by the user.
- It would be great to have an easy app, where i can live give in the names of the persons, which had contact to me. These contacts remain saved within 14 days. Also the numbers of the people are saved, so I can write automated a selfmade message, if I'm sick or I'm tested positive on Corona. On reason for Data protection, the app works only local. The user has to write the info message bit himself.
anonymous  GPS and BLE beacon monitoring (elderly people). Main user screen consists of one button to report feeling unwell. Doctors confirms alarms notifying all people who have been in contact for at least 5 minutes in the last 6 days with the “positive man”
- Develop a smart-phone app to make users aware of infected or exposed in proximity. In addition, trace contacts based on movement. 
This challenge could be achieved using mobile phones and their Bluetooth functionalities, with a method that protects the privacy of users. This is a difficult problem, but there are several solutions that have been developed, notably in Singapore and South Korea. An analysis of these tools and their applicability in Switzerland could be interesting. 
- Any comon smartphone can track movement of its user via GPS and WLAN. As long as the user is  healthy, there is no need to reveal his location. If a user shows symptoms the location of the last e.g. 3 days before can be ""published"" anonymously. Zero-Knowledge-Proof might be a concept here.  Home adress should be excluded. The app compares the private track of the last e.g. 14 days to the published tracks and returns the result. User respond frequently: 1 healthy, 2 symptoms,  but no test result, 3 pos. test. Extensions can be analysis of private risk bad on behavior, aggregated data for other stakeholders, upload of Google tracking for joiners, adding locations manually, ...

Based on our general understanding of virus, vaccine and immunology, we know that vaccine works by training immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria, and can safely learn to recognize them as hostile invaders, produce antibodies, and remember them for the future. If the bacteria or virus reappears, these memory cells recognize antigens on the pathogens they have encountered before, triggering the immune system to respond faster and more effectively than on the first exposure.

Combing the two facts into one reveal that the 80% people already have antibodies in their body which can reacts COVID-19. Therefore, antibodies screening database of the of the mild case patients or recovered people may significantly shorten duration of a medical solution.

- A believe network it would be useful to cover the asymptomatic period and use it in a shared inference model between peers which have a meeting plan. In top of that, a great contact tracing tool is formed, where targeted risk points could be notified, while respecting gdpr. 
- Empower individuals with knowledge of their social network (they will need to populate the graph or connect with others already in the graph) and provide analysis to identify small networks that can be engaged with and represent a reduced risk of contraction / dissemination, and which connections may be the gateways to larger networks representing greater risk.  The benefit is we can start to connect again in a considered manner that will also continue to help slow the spread of the virus.
- Limit the spread of the virus by having everyone's risk profile.This would help us understand who is most likely to get the virus,  who already had the virus and recovered, who came into contact with someone that was confirmed to have the virus, who needs to get tested with priority or home quarantined. We can also use this app to send notifications to the users when they are close by (eg 10 m) to someone that has a high risk of getting the virus (based on the nature of their job, eg: doctors) or they are next to someone that are in the risk category if they catch the virus (two different type of notifications: one to protect yourself, one to protect the people from the risk category (eg: elderly,people that have previous health conditions)","Several resources have been requested:

tend to believe fake news. The problem: in this situation, fake news can kill. (ex: warm tea kills the virus, god will protect us, it's just like the flu, X or Y medicine is the cure, etc.). Communications from public health experts, scientists and some governments are not trusted by a significant part of the population who choses to believe other sources of (dis)information. Trust is key in public policies depending on (long-term) behavioral responses from the public. How can we restore trust in facts?
